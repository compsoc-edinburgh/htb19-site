        <p>Welcome to code golf!</p>
           <p>The task is simple: solve the problem below in any language of your choice in as few characters as possible.
               Your program should take input from stdin, and print the correct result to stdout.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows the lovely fibonacci sequence:</p>
        1 1 2 3 5 8 ...
           <p>Did you know you can make different sequences by changing the starting number?
               For example, the next fib sequence starts with 1 and 2, like so:</p>
           1 2 3 5 8 13 ...
        <p>And the third,</p>
           1 3 4 7 ...
        <p>And the fourth,<p>
            1 4 5 9 ...
        <p>The nth sequence is denoted</p>
           1 n n+1 n+n+1 ... and so on
           <p>A final sequence, the fibfib sequence, can be created by taking the nth term of the nth sequence, so</p>
           1 2 4 9 ...
        <p>The sum of this sequence as you go along is</p>
           1 3 7 16 ...
           <p>Your program should take an integer n and produce the sum of the first n terms of the fibfib sequence.
           Remember, in real languages, arrays start at zero!
           As such, the input 0 should should produce 1, input 1 should produce 3, input 2 should produce 7</p>
            <p>Go!</p>
